0,GLA Grants data – London Datastore,"The GLA Grants Dataset contains data relating to grants which have been awarded by the GLA since 2013. The dataset uses the 360 Giving Standard, to ensure the data is clear and accessible. This dataset can also be accessed on the 360 giving navigation site GrantNav, which allows grant-makers and others to explore how grants are used, areas of commonality between grant-makers and gaps that are not reached by grant-makers. Potential grant-seekers can also see who and what the GLA has funded in the past. "
1,Animal rescue incidents attended by LFB – London Datastore,"The London Fire Brigade attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call 'special services'). These 'special services' include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress. 
We routinely get asked for information about the number of such incident attended by the London Fire Brigade and this data is published on the London Datastore to assist those who require it.
The data is provided from January 2009 and isupdated monthly. A range of information is supplied for each incident including some location information (postcode, borough, ward), as well as the data/time of the incidents. We do not routinely record data about animal deaths or injuries. 
Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.
The London Fire Commissioner is the fire and rescue authority for London and runs the London Fire Brigade."
2,Bariatric incidents attended by LFB – London Datastore,"The London Fire Brigade attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call 'special services'). These 'special services' include assistance to other emergency services, including sometimes help with moving larger (i.e. bariatric) patients/people. Although the LFB does not explicitly capture and classify these types of incidents, we are able to identify them via the messages that are transmitted during incidents.  
We routinely get asked for information about the number of such incident attended by the London Fire Brigade and this data is published on the London Datastore to assist those who require it.
The data is provided from January 2009 and is updated monthly. A range of information is supplied for each incident including some location information (postcode sector, borough, ward), as well as the data/time of the incidents.
The data we collect about these incidents does not routinely include any information about the patient or the nature of any illness, or the reason for assistance.

3,Breathe London AQMesh pods – London Datastore,"The Breathe London stationary network is made up of 100 AQMesh pods, each containing a collection of small sensor-based air quality monitors that offer near real-time localised air quality information. They measure nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and nitric oxide (NO) using electrochemical sensors; particulate matter (PM) in various size cuts (PM₂.₅ and PM10 are reported) using a light-scattering optical particle counter; and carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a non-dispersive infrared absorbance sensor. In some locations, the pods measure ozone (O3), also using electrochemical sensors. The pods measure temperature, humidity and air pressure for the purposes of correction for environmental conditions. Each sensor pod is set up to collect data continuously for 10-second intervals and to create an average every 1-15 minutes, synchronised to the top of each hour.
More information can be found on the Breathe London website."
4,Natural Capital Account for London – London Datastore,"This is the first natural capital account for London, and was supported by the Mayor of London, the National Trust and the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The natural capital account assesses the economic value of different benefits that London and Londoners gain from the city’s public parks and other green spaces. For more information on the methodology and results of this analysis, please see the London.gov.uk website.

5,Life Expectancy at Birth and Age 65 by Ward – London Datastore,"This series has been discontinued.
Life expectancy at birth and age 65 by sex and ward, London borough, region, 1999/03 - 2010/14.
The population data used is revised 2002-2010 ONS mid year estimates (MYE) - revised post 2011 Census. Revised population estimates by single year of age for wards can also be found on the ONS website for 2002-2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. These figures are consistent with the published revised mid-2002 to mid-2010 local authority estimates.
Rolling 5-year combined life expectancies are used for wards to reduce the effects of the variability in number of deaths in each year. The same method is applied to higher geographies to enable meaningful comparisons. However, 3-year combined expectancies are published separately on the Datastore for geographical areas that are local authority and above.
If the GLA publish revised 2002-2010 population data for wards then these life expectancy figures will also be revised to reflect them.
The ONS vital statistics mortality data breaks deaths into 10 year age bands. 5 year age band deaths were modelled using this data.
Vital Statistics: Population and Health Reference Tables are available on the ONS website here.
The tool for calculating life expectancy is available from Public Health England.  The highest age band in the calculator is currently 85+. If the tool is updated with a higher upper age band (ie 90+), this data will be revised to reflect this change.
Healthy life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy (1999-2003) at birth have been calculated for wards in England and Wales. These can be found on the ONS website.
This data is also presented in the GLA ward profiles."
6,"Number of Registered Blind and Partially Sighted People by Age Group, Borough – London Datastore","This data shows the number of people registered with Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs) in England as being blind and partially sighted by age, for years ending 31 March.
Age groups are: 0-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75 and over.
A decision was made to bring the most recent collection forward by a year for collection in 2008, due to concerns regarding the fall in the number of people newly registered as blind and partially sighted between March 2003 and March 2006. This means there will be no collection in 2009. Tables contain information relating to the year ended 31 March 2008.
The register is voluntary; however it is a precondition for the receipt of certain financial benefits. This is a factor that gives more credibility to the register for blind than to the register of the partially sighted.
The reliability of this information is difficult to determine and so cannot be thought of as a definitive number of blind and partially sighted people.

9,Road Casualties by Severity – London Datastore,"Casualties on the roads by severity (Killed/seriously injured or slight injuries) for both child and all casualties by borough since 2004. 
Casualties by 5 year age group and severity for London and Great Britain.
Data presented is for personal injury road traffic collisions occurring on the public highway, and reported to the police, in accordance with the Stats 19 national reporting system.
Also available: Casualties on the roads by LSOA, MSOA and Ward by severity for years 2010 to 2014.
Incident level data:
Casualty data for all road accidents 2010 to 2014 are also available for individual incident level in CSV format (11 MB and 87k rows).
There are slight differences between the local authority recorded in the official DFT data and this one, which has been geo-coded using the Easting and Northing of the accident. When an accident happens on a borough boundary it is down to the police officer to decide which borough the accident occured in. However, this data uses uses the centre points of the Easting and Northing provided and this can fall into a different local authority. For this reason, the geography in the geo-coded data is not official but does provide indicative information.
Incident level data from 2005 onwards is available from TFL ('data extracts')."
10,Road Collisions by Severity – London Datastore,"Road Collisions Data by fatal, serious or slight severity casualty groups by borough and ward.
