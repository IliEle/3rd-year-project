The debate is called ‘managing the multi-cloud’. CIOs and CTOs want people to feel empowered to adopt cloud-based IT services – but they also need to ensure they don't create an uncontrollable multi-cloud environment. Amongst a range of issues, we’ll ask what are the best techniques to manage ‘cloud sprawl’ across an Enterprise.  We expect around 20 – 30 CIOs and CTOs in total to keep the debate lively and allow everyone to participate fully. We'll start the evening with drinks at 6.30pm and wrap up by around 9.30pm ","CSC, Dr Sanjiv Gossain ",Offer declined
